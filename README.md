# GROMACS Crash Course

GROMACS is a very potent and versatile Open Source Molecular Dynamics simulation program.
Since it has no GUI, one has to start, control and run it via the terminal or a shell script.

During the following two days we will
1. learn how to use the Unix/Linux shell (via a terminal),
2. install GROMACS,
3. learn basic GROMACS usage.

## 1. The Unix Shell
To install and use GROMACS a basic knowledge regarding the use of the Unix/Linux shell is mandatory.
Thus, we will start with a "Software Carpentry" Unix shell lesson via the following link:

## 2. Install GROMACS
We will install GROMACS 2018 (for documentation see: http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/2018.8/index.html).
Therefore, at first, we have to download the GROMACS source code from

http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/2018.8/download.html#source-code

an perform the installation following the instructions on

http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/2018.8/install-guide/index.html

Firstly, we will try the "quick and dirty" installation, but if we run into trouble in doing so,
we might need to try the more elaborated instructions.
